## Instructions
### I highly recommend using XCode, as it is Swift's native IDE/Compiler. Xcode can obtained on Mac-OS, and use Swift 3, as there are new features implemented in this Application. 
1. Install Xcode - open up this project
2. Build/Run
3. Please use this for educational purposes only.
